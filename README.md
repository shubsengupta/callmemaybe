# Sunrise - Social Alarm Clock

Sunrise is a social alarm clock, inspired by today's generation of snapchat lovers and tinder-ers.

0. A user (User A) sets an alarm, as they would normally, for when they'd like to wake up.
0. Around the selected time, another user (User N) around the world is given a notification to wake them up, as well as a random challenge to theme the call (ranging from telling a scary story, making someone laugh, to flattery, and more).
0. User A is automatically dropped in to a video chat with User N, and woken up to a complete surprise around sunrise.
0. If both Users had a great experience, they can drop in to a text chat to continue their conversation.
